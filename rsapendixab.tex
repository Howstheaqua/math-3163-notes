\section{Appendix A Logic and Proof}
\subsection*{Propositions}
A \textbf{proposition} is a declarative statement that can be either true or false.

EX$\colon$ 2 is a positive integer
\subsection*{Compound Statements}
A \textbf{compound statement} is when two or more statements are combined using words like "or" and "and."

$P$ and $Q$ is true when both $P$ and $Q$ are true, otherwise it is false.

$P$ or $Q$ is true when one or both are true and false when both are false.
\subsection*{Negation}
\textbf{Negation}($\lnot$) changes the meaning of a proposition by inverting it.
Changing its outcome from false to true and vice versa.

\subsection*{Quantifiers}
Universal quantifiers ($\forall$) are used to state that a statement is true for all values of a variable.
EX$\colon$ For all $x$, $x^2$ is a positive integer.


Existential quantifiers ($\exists$) are used to state that a statement is true for at least one value of a variable.
EX$\colon$ There exists a positive integer $x$ such that $x^2$ is a perfect square.


The negation of a statement with a universal quantifier
is a statement with an existential quantifier. 

\subsection*{Conditional Statements}
A \textbf{conditional statement} is a statement is a \emph{if-then} statement.

EX$\colon$ If $x$ is a positive integer, then $x^2$ is a positive integer.


Conditional statements are written symbolically as $Q \implies P$ 
\
$P \implies Q$ is a true statement when both P and Q are
true and false when P is true and Q is false. 
The contrapositive of the conditional statement $P \implies Q$ is the statement $\lnot Q \implies \lnot P$. 
\subsection*{Proofs}

There are 3 main types of proofs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Direct Proof
    \item Contrapositive Proof
    \item Proof by Contradiction
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Direct Proof}
A \textbf{direct proof} is a proof that shows that a statement is true by showing that each of its premises is true.
This method relies on the rule of logic called 
\textbf{modus ponens$\colon$} If $R$ is a true statement and $R \implies S $ is a true conditional
statement, then $S$ is a true statement.


\textbf{Example$\colon$}(from the book) To prove the theorem $ P \implies Q$ by the direct
method, you find a series of statements $P_1$, $P_2$,\ldots, $P_n$ 
and the verify that each of the implications $P_n\implies P_{n+1}$ is true.
Then
the assumption that $P$ is true and repeated use of \textbf{modus ponens} show that $Q$ is true.

\subsection*{Contrapositive Proof}
A \textbf{contrapositive proof} is a proof that shows that a statement is true by showing that the contrapositive of the statement is true.

\end{figure}
\subsection*{Proof by Contradiction}
A \textbf{proof by contradiction} is a proof that shows that a statement is true by showing that the negation of the statement is false.

To prove a multi conditional statement you must prove all parts of it.

\section{Appendix B Sets and Functions}

\subsection*{Sets}
A \textbf{set} is a collection of objects.
For Example $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers.
$\emptyset$ is the empty set.

\subsection*{Subsets}
A set $B$ is said to be a subset of a set $C$ (written $B \subseteq C$) provided that every element of
$B$ is also an element of $C$. Sets are also subsets of themselves

\subsection*{Set Operations}
Set operations are used to combine sets.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Union $\cup$ is the set of all elements that are in either set.
    \item Intersection $\cap$ is the set of all elements that are in both sets.
    \item Difference $\setminus$ is the set of all elements that are in the first set but not the second.
    \item Complement $\bar{A}$ is the set of all elements that are not in the set.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Functions}
A \textbf{function} is a rule that assigns to each element of a set exactly one element of another set.
\textbf{Example$\colon$} A set $P$ of integers are mapped to a set $Q$ of real numbers by the function $f(x) = x^2$. This can also be written as $P \to Q$.

\subsection*{Binary Operations}
A \textbf{binary operation} is a function that takes two arguments and returns a single value.

\subsection*{Injective and Surjective Functions}
A function is \textbf{injective} if no two elements of the domain map to the same element of the range. Or it is \textbf{one-to-one}.
